# liver_disease_prediction

This is a self-record repository of a project the owner has done in summer 2020.

Very basic code but enables me to learn Python and Machine Learning from scratch.

The project setup comes from the Kaggle challenge (Liver Disease Prediction), which could be retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/benuvarghesebenjamin/liver-disease-prediction/notebook. The dataset of the code comes from the website as well.

The main algorithm used is Decision Trees and Supporting Vector Machines. The precision rate of the model is about 0.8 and f1 score is about 0.8.
